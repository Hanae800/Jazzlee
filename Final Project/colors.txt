I love color.I love flaming red.And vivid green.And royal flaunting flower.I love the startled rose of the sun at dawning.And the blazing orange of it at twilight.I love color.I love the drowsy blue of the fringed gentian.And the yellow of the goldenrod.And the rich russet of the leaves.That turn at autumn-time.I love rainbows.And prisms.And the tinsel glitter.Of every shop-window.I love color.And yet today. greenI saw a brown little bird.Perched on the dull-gray fence.Of a weed-filled city yard.And as I watched him. The little bird. blueThrew back his head.Defiantly, almost.And sang a song.That was full of gay ripples.And poignant sweetness.And half-hidden melody. orangeI love color.I love crimson, and azure. redAnd the glowing purity of white.And yet today.I saw a living bit of brown.A vague oasis on a streak of gray.That brought heaven.Very near to me.
